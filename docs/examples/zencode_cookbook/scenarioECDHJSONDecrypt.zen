Given that I am known as 'Bob' 
Given I have my 'keypair' 
Given I have a 'public key' from 'Alice'

When I decrypt the text of 'secretForBob' from 'Alice'
When I rename the 'text' to 'DecryptedtextForBobBase64'
Then print the 'DecryptedtextForBobBase64' as 'base64'
# The header is here the "DefaultHeader" so we won't print
